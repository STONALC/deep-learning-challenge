Report on the analysis of analytical model for selecting Alphabet Soup Applicants

A. Introduction

This report presents a brief analysis of the neural network model used for selecting applicants for funding from the nonprofit foundation
called Alphabet Soup. The purpose of the report is to present an analytical model for informed decision-making on the binary selection of candidates for funding.

B. The model employed

The model employed for the task of predicting the decision-making process is called neural network model. Using this model, we ran an analysis focused on our chances of making the right selection between two binary choices. One choice is "successful" and the other is "unsuccessful". We sought to obtain a predictive accuracy of 75%. To do this, we adopted two approaches. One approach invoved running the model in google colab and the other approach involved running the model in a jupyter notebook.

1. Google colab

In google colab, we built the model, using all the relevant codes. When we ran the model, we obtained a predictive accuracy of 0.7268804907798767 or 72%. This is 3 percentage points below the predictive accuracy that we set out to achieve. Because we did not meet our predictive accuracy goal, we set out to run the model in a jupyter notebook to see whether we could derive the 75% predictive accuracy.


2. jupyter notebook

We then ran a second model in jupyter notebook. As done previously in google colab, we built the model, using all the required codes.Upon running the model, we derived a predictive accuracy of 58%. This accuracy level is 17 percentage points below the 75% predictive accuracy level that we are looking for. 


C. Conclusion derived

The conclusion derived is that we could not achieve the 75% predictive accuracy. On the first run, we achieved 72% accuracy. With a 72% accuracy, it shows that the chances of accurately predicting success stand at 0.72 or 72%, which is within 3 percentage points of our statistical goal. On the other hand, the 58% shows that our chances of predicting success stand at 0.58 or 58% which is 17 percentage points below our statistical goal.

Given more time, it is possible that we could have run the model several more times to achieve the 75% predictive model.
